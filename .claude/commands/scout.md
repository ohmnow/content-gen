# Purpose

Search the codebase for files needed to complete the task using a fast, token efficient agent.

## Variables

USER_PROMPT: $1
SCALE: $2 (defaults to 3)
RELEVANT_FILE_OUTPUT_DIR: `agents/scout_files/`

## Instructions

- You're job is to search the codebase for files needed to complete the task.
- IMPORTANT: You're job is not to implement the task, you're job is to find the files needed to complete the task.
- Use the Task tool to create `SCALE` number of agents in parallel to search the codebase for files needed to complete the task.

## Workflow

- Write a prompt for `SCALE` number of agents to the Task tool that will immediately call the Bash tool to run these commands to kick off your agents to conduct the search:
  - `claude -p "[prompt]" --model sonnet` 
  - `gemini -p "[prompt]" --model gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025` (if count >= 2)
  - `opencode run [prompt] --model cerebras/qwen-3-coder-480b` (if count >= 3)
  - `gemini -p "[prompt]" --model gemini-2.5-pro` (if count >= 4)
  - `codex exec -m gpt-5-codex -s read-only -c model_reasoning_effort="medium" "[prompt]"` (if count >= 5)
- How to prompt the agents:
  - IMPORTANT: Kick these agents off in parallel using the Task tool.
  - IMPORTANT: These agents are calling OTHER agentic coding tools to search the codebase. DO NOT call any search tools yourself.
  - IMPORTANT: That means with the Task tool, you'll immediately call the Bash tool to run the respective agentic coding tool (gemini, opencode, claude, etc.)
  - IMPORTANT: Instruct the agents to quickly search the codebase for files needed to complete the task. This isn't about a full blown search, just a quick search to find the files needed to complete the task.
  - Instruct the subagent to use a timeout of 3 minutes for each agent's bash call. Skip any agents that don't return within the timeout, don't restart them.
  - Make it absolutely clear that the Task tool is ONLY going to call the Bash tool and pass in the appropriate prompt, replacing the [prompt] with the actual prompt you want to run.
  - Make it absolutely clear the agent is NOT implementing the task, the agent is ONLY searching the codebase for files needed to complete the task.
  - Prompt the agent to return a structured list of files with specific line ranges in this format:
    - `- <path to file> (offset: N, limit: M)` where offset is the starting line number and limit is the number of lines to read
    - If there are multiple relevant sections in the same file, repeat the entry with different offset/limit values
  - Execute additional agent calls in round robin fashion.
  - Give them the relevant information needed to complete the task.
  - Skip any agent outputs that are not relevant to the task including failures and errors.
  - If any agents don't return in the proper format, don't try to fix it for them, just ignore their output and continue with the next agents responses. 
  - IMPORTANT: Again, don't search for the agents themselves, just call the Bash tool with the appropriate prompt.
- After the agents complete, run `git diff --stat` to make sure no files were changed. If there are any changes run `git reset --hard` to reset the changes.
- Follow the `Report` section to manage and report the results. We're going to create a file to store the results.

## Report

- Collect the outputs from the agents into a structured bullet point list of files with line ranges needed to complete the task
- Format: `- <path to file> (offset: N, limit: M)`
- Merge any duplicates with overlapping line ranges
- Skip any files that don't have any offset/limit values
- If multiple sections of the same file are needed, list them as separate entries
- Write this list to a file: `RELEVANT_FILE_OUTPUT_DIR/relevant_files_<unique-id>.md` where unique-id is a timestamp or random string
- Report only the file path to this relevant files collection
